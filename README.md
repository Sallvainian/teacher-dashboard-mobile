## 🏗 Architecture

### Store-Based State Management
The application uses a comprehensive store architecture for scalable state management:

- **`authStore`** - User authentication and session management
- **`settingsStore`** - Theme, preferences, and app configuration
- **`chatStore`** - Real-time messaging with typing indicators
- **`filesStore`** - File upload, organization, and sharing
- **`gradebookStore`** - Grade management with local/cloud sync
- **`uiStore`** - Shared UI state (modals, views, search)

### Service Layer
Clean separation of business logic through dedicated services:

- **`fileService`** - File operations and Supabase storage
- **`supabaseService`** - Database operations with fallbacks
- **`cacheService`** - Performance optimization and offline support

### Database Schema
- **Users & Authentication** - Role-based access (teacher/student)
- **Classes & Students** - Hierarchical class organization
- **Grades & Assignments** - Flexible grading with categories
- **Messages & Conversations** - Real-time chat with participants
- **Files & Folders** - Organized file storage with sharing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - No implicit `any`, explicit null checks
- **Svelte 5 Patterns** - Modern runes ($state, $derived, $props)
- **Component Structure** - Imports → Types → Props → State → Effects → Functions → Markup
- **Store Pattern** - Centralized state with actions and derived values
